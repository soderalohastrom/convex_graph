# Product Context: Convex Graph

## Why This Project Exists
To provide users with a personal knowledge management system that connects entities (people, places, things) with thoughts and ideas. The application helps users organize their mental models and discover relationships between concepts.

## Problems Solved
1. Fragmented personal knowledge across different tools
2. Difficulty connecting related concepts
3. Lack of automated enrichment for thoughts
4. Inefficient organization of personal insights

## How It Should Work
1. Users authenticate via Convex Auth
2. Create and manage entities (people, places, pets)
3. Record thoughts and connect them to entities
4. Automatically enrich thoughts using OpenAI
5. Visualize connections between entities and thoughts

## User Experience Goals
- Simple and intuitive interface for adding content
- Fast search and filtering capabilities
- Visual graph of relationships between entities
- Contextual enrichment of thoughts
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Seamless synchronization between devices
