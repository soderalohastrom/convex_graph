# Project Progress

## What Works
- Project structure established
- Memory bank documentation created
- Convex schema defined
- Frontend entry point configured
- Environment variables set up

## What's Left to Build
1. Complete entity management UI
2. Implement thought creation interface
3. Add OpenAI integration for thought enrichment
4. Develop relationship visualization
5. Implement search functionality

## Current Status
- Documentation phase complete
- Ready for development setup verification
- Core backend functionality implemented
- Basic frontend scaffolding in place

## Known Issues
1. OpenAI integration not yet implemented
2. Authentication flow needs testing
3. Entity-thought relationships not visualized
4. Mobile responsiveness not verified
5. Error handling incomplete

## Decision Evolution
- Changed from manual API routes to Convex automatic endpoints
- Simplified data model by removing separate relationships table
- Delayed AI features until core functionality is stable
- Adopted Tailwind CSS over custom styling for faster development
