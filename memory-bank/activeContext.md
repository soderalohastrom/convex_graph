# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
1. Setting up local development environment
2. Creating memory bank documentation
3. Verifying application functionality

## Recent Changes
- Created initial memory bank files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - techContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md

## Next Steps
1. Create new Convex project:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure OpenAI API key in `.env.local` (if needed)
4. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Verify authentication flow
6. Test entity and thought management

## Active Decisions
- Using existing Convex deployment credentials
- Keeping OpenAI integration disabled until verified
- Focusing on core functionality before enrichment features

## Important Patterns
- Convex schema-first development
- React component composition
- Tailwind utility class styling
- Environment-based configuration

## Learnings
- Convex provides automatic API generation from schema
- React 19 simplifies state management
- Tailwind enables rapid UI development
- Vite offers fast development experience
